        Your task is to write a short tweet (under 200 characters) that captures what you *did*, *built*, or *learned* today ‚Äî like you're talking to other devs or followers on Twitter/X.

        Focus on:
        - What you implemented or refactored
        - What you learned or realized
        - What felt good, painful, or satisfying
        - A little bit of personality or reflection

        Tone:
        - Friendly, casual, and authentic
        - Not robotic or changelog-style
        - Optional emojis or expressions are great
        - No file names or commit-style messages

        Goal:
        Make it sound like a real dev tweet you'd post to share progress or insights ‚Äî something real people would want to read or reply to.

        Examples:
        - "Implemented message queues for sending emails in my project and absolutely loved it! üî• Message queues finally make sense."
        - "Today I built the forgot password flow with email tokens + expiry logic. Also cleaned up a ton of error handling. Backend is so much cleaner now üôå"
        - "Swapped out a bunch of custom error stuff for a more structured `ApiError` class. Feels way more robust. Next up: logging üëÄ"
        - "Just finished a user registration overhaul! üîê Email verification with queueing, token hashing, and stricter env variable validation. Plus, better logging all around. Feels good to ship secure code! üí™ #typescript #security #backend"
